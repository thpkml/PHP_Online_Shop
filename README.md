# PHP Online Clothing Store
A guide to make a simple PHP and MySQL based online shop. 
## What
The repository contains all the code required in order to build your own online shop from scratch.  
The features include:  
- Front end for customers
- Paypal payment gateway integration
- Admin backend to manage items, prices, orders and people
## Why
There are tons of readymade solutions out there that provide a lot of ecommerce features out of the box.  
This application is in no way claiming to compete with those. Instead, this is aimed at providing a working  
base upon which the developer can add as many functionalitites as needed. Since it is built from scratch,  
the system builder will have a full control of the application. 
## Who
This repository is aimed at beginners in PHP development to learn building simple but functioning web application.  
It is also aimed at intermediate PHP developers who are looking for a fully customisable app base to build upon. 
## Usage
Feel free to use the codes as you like. Share if someone needs it.  
You are welcome to clone the repo (I have even left the node_modules intact, sorry GitHub),  
But if you are new to PHP development -  
please read a little more about how to launch a PHP application and the system prerequisites.
